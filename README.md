IRM_Leaver_Data Merge  and Convert Date Format to ISO 8601

In this document, I will demonstrate one of the key elements for insider risk management, which is leaver data. As you know, insider risk management pays attention, especially to leaver data, and these users will be monitored closely. It will boost the risk level if there is any suspicious activity. 
Getting leaver data in the expected format might be challenging sometimes. First of all, I am totally sure HR is not saving the leaver date in the ISO 8601 format, and this is the first blocker. For a few users, it might not be a challenge, but if we talk about many users and a big organization, then the party starts. 
There may be various scenarios to consider, but letâ€™s focus on one in particular. Assuming HR has provided the data as outlined, we need to merge these two Excel files into a single document and also correct the date format. To achieve this goal, I wrote the script below, and I feel fortunate because my new best friend, Copilot, has been a tremendous support throughout the process.

The script is designed to assist us in merging the data into a single Excel file in the desired format outlined below.

One notable advantage of this method is that the Excel formula will be preserved as text within the Excel file.
